## Introduction
This workshop guides you through the process of provisioning a MySQL HeatWave database on OCI, enhancing a Spring Boot application with Oracle AI code assistant, incorporating OpenTelemetry instrumentation, and deploying the application on an Oracle Kubernetes cluster. You will learn how to monitor the application using the Oracle Application Performance Management Service, leveraging OpenTelemetry traces and metrics for comprehensive end-to-end monitoring and diagnostics. Additionally, the workshop covers the utilization of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Database Management to monitor the MySQL HeatWave database and Logging Analytics for Kubernetes and application logs.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Create an APM domain, obtain Data Upload Endpoint and Data Keys
* Create Oracle Kubernetes cluster 
* Create MySQL HeatWave Database 
* Use Oracle AI Code Assist to build microservice application 
*	Instrument APM Browser agent and Open telemetry auto instrumentation of server code
*	Use APM Trace Explorer to view traces, spans, and span dimensions
* Use Database Management to review query performances
* Use Logging analytics to analyze Kubernetes logs 

### Prerequisites
